# Federal Student Loan Analysis

### The purpose of my project is to analyze student loan data within the United States in an effort to understand the amount of student loan debt within the United States, as well as patterns that may emerge based on location, type of school, as well as types of loans.
To start, I will be doing an analysis of yearly student loan data found on Federal Student Aid: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/student. I plan on utilizing Python pandas as well as plotly as my main source of data cleaning and data visualization. As I begin to gain more experience in data analysis, I will be making regular updates to this repository in hopes to create a deeper analysis of federal student loan data from year to year.
